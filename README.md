# Mycroft

Mycroft is a toolkit for doing text classification with word embeddings.
It provides a command line interface for training and evaluating different kinds of neural network classifiers and a
programmatic interface for incorportating these classifiers into other programs.

## Installation

Install Mycroft by running `python setup.py install`.

Mycroft depends uses the [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) text natural language processing toolkit to parse text.
By default it installs spaCy's English language text model, though you may specify other language models from the
command line.
See spaCy's [models documentation](https://spacy.io/docs/usage/models) for more information.


## Running

Run Mycroft with the command `mycroft`.
Subcommands enable you to train models and use them to make predictions on unlabeled data sets.
Run `mycroft --help` for details about specific commands.

The training data is a comma- or tab-delimited file with column of text and a column of labels.
The test data is in the same format without the labels.

Run `mycroft demo` to see a quick example of the command line syntax and data formats.

## Classifier Models

Mycroft implements two kinds of word-embedding models.

* __Neural bag of words__

  300-dimensional [GloVe](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) vectors are used to embed the tokens in the text.
  A softmax layer uses the average of the token embeddings to make a label prediction.

* __Neural text sequence__

  The same GloVe vectors are used to embed the text into matrices of size _sequence length Ã— 300_, clipping or padding
  the first dimension for each individual text as needed.
  A recursive neural network (either an LSTM or GRU) converts these embeddings to a single vector which a softmax layer
  then uses to make a label prediction.

As a comparison baseline Mycroft also implements one non-word embedding model.

* __Word count__

  This model trains an SVM over TF-IDF of words.

These models are available programmatically through the `BagOfWordsEmbeddingClassifier`,
`TextSequenceEmbeddingClassifier`, and `WordCountClassifier` classes in `mycroft.model`.
